# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

This project was an exersize in the correct use of bootstrap in creating the layout for a responsive profile page for my future work. The intention is to continue to develop this page as my skills develop in the upcoming months. When finished I'll be able to share this profile page with employers to showcase milestones and personal projects.
